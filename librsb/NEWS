List of user visible changes for each librsb release.

 librsb Version 1.3.0.2 (20221018+), changes:
 - Internals:
  * Now with './configure --enable-debug' rsb_lib_init checks that OpenMP implementation is not a stub (e.g. in AOCC).
  * If using Fortran, make rsb.mod's rsb.F90 part of -lrsb (for Cray Fortran 14).
  * rsb_coo_sort: fix crash on nr==0 (now will silently accept).
 - Compatibility:
  * examples/fortran.F90: don't use implied do on a triangular index space, so it builds on flang-13, too.
  * configure: guess clang flags for Cray version of clang.
  * make qtests: increase tests numerical tolerances when using Cray compiler.
  * Will build and perform tests on systems without setenv(), too (then using putenv() if possible).
  * Honour the $(EXEEXT) suffix (e.g. in Windows)
 - Misc minor
  * fix a format error on long indices on 32-bit architectures
  * Improve documentation of rsb_strerror_r().

 librsb Version 1.3.0.1 (20220429), changes:
 - API:
  * RSB.F90: Functions accepting strings use 'CHARACTER(C_CHAR), DIMENSION(*)' instead of 'TYPE(C_PTR), VALUE'; so now one must pass C_NULL_CHAR instead of C_NULL_PTR.
  * rsb.h: additional input checks in rsb_mtx_rndr().
  * rsb.hpp: additional input checks in the C++ wrappers.
  * librsb-config: add '--cxxflags' switch for most of the flags used for compiling the library.
 - Portability:
  * No unaligned memory access in 'rsbench --read-performance-record' (fix for armhf,sparc64 architectures).
  * Avoid (unused) out-of-bounds memory read in rsb_spsv()/rsb_spsm().
  * Build-time improvements for cross-compilation.
  * Build-time improvements for MacOS, AIX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD.
  * Build with compilers not supporting OpenMP, too.
  * Build (cut-down) test programs even if certain system headers missing.
  * Improved compatibility with shells other than 'bash'.
  * Support "IBM XL" Fortran: if 'xlf' detected, use unmangled C symbols for Fortran.
 - Test system:
  * Fortified 'make qtests' and 'make itests' for various atypical configurations.
  * Reduced duration of rsb_lib_init(): it was slowing down 'make qtests' under rsbtest/.
 - Usage of the configure script:
  * Add '--disable-c++-examples': do not build C++ example programs.
  * Add '--disable-programs': build almost no test or example program.
  * Disable all C++ components with './configure CXX=" "'.
  * Add a check to determine if C++ linker inadequate to link Fortran programs (as observed on Intel OneAPI compilers icx/icpx/ifx). Override check by using '--enable-fortran-linker' or '--disable-fortran-linker'.
  * Out-of-dir now transparent: does not require use of '--with-librsbpp', '--with-rsblib', '--with-rsbtest'.
  * Can pass custom OPENMP_CFLAGS OPENMP_CXXFLAGS OPENMP_FCFLAGS
 - Internals:
  * More internal consistency checks.
  * Fewer potential compile-time warnings.
 - Misc:
  * 'rsbench -I' will print out 'CXXFLAGS', too


 librsb Version 1.3.0.0 (20220121), changes:

 - Major changes:
  * Considerably improved performance of rsb_spmm()/usmm() via new kernels (can be turned off at runtime by setting 'RSB_WANT_RSBPP=0' in the environment).
  * Added a C++ API (classes RsbMatrix and RsbLib) in new header <rsb.hpp>.
  * Enhanced test suite considerably (e.g. using Google Test, if detected), with a much higher coverage than in librsb-1.2.
  * Added 'make itests' Makefile target: post-install tests.
  * Environment variable 'RSB_NUM_THREADS' now used by default (implicit configure '--enable-rsb-num-threads').
  * Revised error messages.
  * Revised help messages.
  * General source code cleanup, less dead code.
  * Better documentation: more examples and snippets.
  * New C++ API examples are in rsblib/examples/.
  * Added a symmetric CSR-to-RSB with autotuning example to fortran_rsb_fi.F90.
  * Fixed integer overflow situations with limit-large matrices.
  * Improved parallelism of rsb_spmv()/rsb_spmm() a bit (no overly strict locking).
  * Improved performance of rsb_spmv()/rsb_spmm() beta-scaling.
  * Most of the helper scripts require the 'bash' shell: expect build problems if you don't have it.
  * 'librsb-config': Added options: '--link', '--fclibs', '--fcflags'.
  * Added './configure --enable-long-indices' option to use 64-bit indices (instead of 32-bit indices) (experimental)
 - Minor changes, related to the API:
  * rsb.h: Renamed function rsb_load_spblas_matrix_file_as_matrix_market() to rsb_blas_file_mtx_load().
  * rsb.h: If passing RSB_FLAG_TRIANGULAR flags to rsb_mtx_alloc_from_coo_inplace() or rsb_mtx_alloc_from_coo_const(), upper or lower triangle will be determined.  Similarly when using rsb_mtx_alloc_from_coo_begin() and rsb_mtx_alloc_from_coo_end().  BLAS property blas_triangular implies triangle auto-detection, too.
  * rsb.h: Added RSB_TRANSPOSITION_INVALID: guaranteed invalid transposition char for transA (useful for initializations).
  * rsb.h: Added rsb_coo_cleanup(), to compact duplicates.
  * rsb.h: Added RSB_ERR_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND error code for rsb_mtx_get_vals() and rsb_mtx_set_vals().
  * If configured with '--enable-interface-error-verbosity=N' (with integer N>0), RSB_ERR_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND won't be returned unnecessarily (is not properly an error).
  * rsb.h: RSB_DIAGONAL flag changed value (now contains RSB_FLAG_TRIANGULAR).
  * rsb.h: rsb_lib_get_opt(RSB_IO_WANT_EXECUTING_THREADS,..) will return number of working threads, even if not overridden.
  * rsb.h: With more threads requested than supported, rsb_lib_init() will print a warning to stderr and continue with the supported number.
  * rsb.h: rsb_lib_init(): Unless disabled, environment variable 'RSB_NUM_THREADS' overrides OMP_NUM_THREADS.
  * rsb.h: It should be safe to call rsb_lib_exit() more than once.
  * rsb.h: Symmetric-diagonal matrices accepted by rsb_spsv()/rsb_spsm().
  * rsb.h: Added RSB_IO_WANT_VERBOSE_INIT option for to rsb_lib_init().
  * rsb.h: RSB_IO_WANT_VERBOSE_INIT makes rsb_lib_reinit() verbose as well.
  * rsb.h: rsb_mtx_add_to_dense() is now threaded.
  * rsb.h: rsb_tune_spmm()/rsb_tune_spsm() with RSB_IO_WANT_VERBOSE_TUNING set to >2 allows to generate tuning trace plots.
  * rsb.h: rsb_file_mtx_load(): Diagnostics less verbose by default.
  * rsb.h: Added checks to rsb_mtx_alloc* functions to spot forgotten rsb_lib_init().
  * rsb.h: rsb_mtx_rndr(): No hostname in EPS plot comments if environment has 'RSB_USE_HOSTNAME=0'.
  * rsb.F90: Added INTERFACE to rsb_blas_file_mtx_load().
  * rsb.h/blas_sparse.h: rsb_lib_exit() will free matrices created via the Sparse BLAS API.
  * blas_sparse.h: Sparse BLAS interface functions have basic checks for uninitialized use of librsb.
  * blas_sparse.h: Added BLAS properties blas_rsb_rep_hwi, blas_rsb_rep_rec (extensions).
  * blas_sparse.h: BLAS interface autotuning max merges/splits count now same as in rsb_tune_spmm().
  * Bugfix: rsb_strerror_r() now honors buflen parameter.
  * Bugfix: can correctly read complex matrix as int (the real components).
  * Bugfix: rsb_mtx_alloc_from_coo_begin() now accepts RSB_NUMERICAL_TYPE_INT as type code.
  * Bugfix: rsb_spmsp() was crashing if result matrix has nnz<=rows.
 - Minor changes, related to the configure script:
  * Added GREP, SED, CUT as configure variables, to allow custom utilities.
  * Default for '--with-max-threads' is now 128.
  * Dropped dependency on <libgen.h>.
  * Added hwloc-based cache detection (e.g. for cygwin).
  * Added '--enable-internal-headers-install', which will define the RSB_HAVE_IHI symbol.
  * Internals: './configure --debug-getenvs' activates reading "RSB_SPSV_OP_FLAG" environment variable to control rsb_spsv() internals.
  * If clang compiler is detected, then add '-latomic' to LIBS.
  * Added '--with-baselib-cflags' customization option.
  * Added '--with-kernels-cflags' customization option.
  * Now '--with-zlib' is on by default.
  * Added '--with-mkl', so it will probe for <mkl/mkl.h> and GNU-linkables.
  * './configure --with-mkl' probes the MKL_INCDIR environment variable unless '--with-mkl-incdir'.
  * './configure --with-mkl --disable-openmp' probes for sequential MKL.
  * './configure --enable-fortran-linker': Use Fortran link command for Fortran examples.
  * './configure --enable-extra-patches' : Activate extra specific patches/workarounds for known compiler bugs (e.g. gcc-11 https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=103995); if available, will use 'spatch' from Coccinelle, otherwise awk.
  * './configure --enable-debug' activates m4 debug comments.
 - Minor changes, related to Makefile rules:
  * Added 'make check' as alias of 'make qtests'.
  * Added 'make realclean', mostly for distro maintainers to clean test artifacts.
  * Added 'make sources' to build sources, e.g. from *.m4 and *.m.
  * Now 'make distclean' will also perform 'cleanall' and 'realclean'.
  * Kind-of-a-bug: out-of-dir builds convert *.m4 into *.c *.h in the distclean directory.
  * Workaround (not solution) to a known Makefile.am bug with 'make dist' when no Sparse BLAS requested, where Makefile will attempt creation of a sbtc.c and sbtf.F90..
 - Minor changes, rsbench-related (these are rather maintainer-oriented, not user-oriented):
  * Added option '--bench' (an alias for multiple options) for easier benchmarking.
  * Default threads will be limited to that of '--with-max-threads=<...>' value.
  * Added options '--want-memory-benchmark' / '--want-no-memory-benchmark', and memory benchmark will not be anymore default on, but will be still implied by --bench.

  * Option '--read-performance-record' can be prepended by --setenv var=val.
  * Dir/file name in .rpr file, when specified one only.
  * MKL version name in .rpr file, when auto-chosen.
  * 'rsbench --bench' prints per-category 'limited' benchmark results before total one.
  * If using '--bench' comparing with the MKL, use the Intel MKL Inspector interface (experimental).
  * When loading matrices through recursion a check will skip 'MatrixMarket matrix array' files.
  * Directories will be traversed recursively by default when using e.g. '-oa -Ob ... <directory>' avoiding dups.
  * Memory benchmark will be executed and saved within the .rpr file.
  * Update to the *.rpr file format: now the environment will be also saved and displayed if environment has "RSB_PR_ENV=1".
  * Internal values for RSB_CC, RSB_CFLAGS, RSB_DETECTED_MEM_HIERARCHY_INFO, and RSB_IO_WANT_MEMORY_HIERARCHY_INFO_STRING will be artificially added using setenv() to the environment so the .rpr file may have them.
  * Added  '... -oa -Ob --setenv var=val' / '--unsetenv val'.
  * Now diagonally filled non-square matrices can be generated, e.g. '--gen-diag 3x40'.
  * Restored a long forgotten test ('-Or').
  * Added option '--implicit-diagonal'.
  * Added option '--no-compare-competitors' to turn off MKL at run time.
  * Emit error message when failing on a path.
  * K,M,G argument suffixes (case insensitive), e.g. './rsbench -g -c 1k -r 2k -l -b1'.
  * Accepts alpha/beta values lists: 'rsbench --alpha -1,1,2 --beta 0,1,2'.
  * 'rsbench --alpha : --beta :' is shorthand for a mix of values.
  * Added option '--inc <stride>'  which will propagate arg to '--incx <stride> --incy <stride>'.
  * Options '--inc', '--incx', '--incy' accept ':' for default values.
  * Stricter error checking in 'rsbench -B'.
  * Added option '--also-implicit-diagonal'.
  * Added option '--as-hermitian'.
  * Added option '--also-symmetries'.
  * Added '--all-blas-types' option, for all implemented BLAS types.
  * 'rsbench --matrix-print' now just as '-P'.
  * Added option '--bench ... --write-performance-record=pfx' : it sets matrix rendering file prefix.
  * Added option 'bench ... --chdir <directory-with-matrices>'.
  * Added option '--matrix-sample-pcnt' to sample read matrices' nonzeroes.
  * Added option '--nmb' as short for '--want-no-memory-benchmark'.
  * Added option '--mkl-no-inspector': will use deprecated Intel MKL Sparse BLAS.
  * Inspector-executor SpBLAS API is now default when comparing to Intel MKL.
  * Added option '--no-submatrix-format-labels' to  'rsbench --plot-matrix'.
  * Added option '--latex' to  'rsbench --plot-matrix'.
  * Added option '--no-transpose' as alias to '--notranspose'.
  * Added option '--expand-symmetry' to rsbench: expand symmetry and remove flags.
  * Appending 'L' in e.g. './rsbench -Q10QL' suppresses limits tests.
  * After loading a matrix file, rsbench sets its values to ones ('--want-no-ones-fill option' to counter that).
  * Option '--matrix-ls' now called '--matrix-ls-latex'.
  * Option '--matrix-ls' now prints plain text.
  * Sped up 'rsbench -M'.
  * Fix to 'rsbench --plot-matrix --nonzeros-dump': will draw dots after blocks.
  * Fix: '-M' was requesting wrong alignment from posix_memalign.

 - fix: rsb_mtx_get_vec(... , ... , RSB_EXTF_SUMS_ROW)) and
        rsb_mtx_get_vec(... , ... , RSB_EXTF_SUMS_COL)) were missing a

  * faster rsb-to-sorted-coo conversion in rsb_mtx_switch_to_coo
  * enabled out-of-tree builds (e.g. one distclean dir and many build dirs)
  * new autotuning mechanisms behind rsb_tune_spmm/rsb_tune_spsm
  * fewer compile time warnings from automatically generated code, e.g. in
    rsb_krnl.c and rsb_libspblas.c
 - programming interface (API) changes: 
  * bugfix w.r.t. 1.1: usmm()/ussm() were not declared in rsb_blas_sparse.F90
  * introduced extension BLAS property blas_rsb_autotune_next_operation
    to trigger auto tuning at the next usmv/usmm call
  * eliminated RSB_FLAG_RECURSIVE_DOUBLE_DETECTED_CACHE and
               RSB_FLAG_RECURSIVE_HALF_DETECTED_CACHE
  * rsb_load_spblas_matrix_file_as_matrix_market() now takes a
    typecode argument. Sets either blas_upper_triangular,
    blas_lower_triangular, blas_upper_hermitian, blas_lower_hermitian,
    blas_upper_symmetric or blas_lower_symmetric property according to
    the loaded file.
  * properly using INTEGER(C_SIGNED_CHAR) for 'typecode' arguments in rsb.F90.
  * rsb.F90 change: all interfaces to functions taking INTEGER arrays now
    require them to be declared as TARGET and passed as pointer
    (via C_LOC()), just as e.g. VA.
  * introduced the RSB_MARF_EPS_L flag for rendering Encapsulated PostScript
    (EPS) matrices (with rsb_mtx_rndr()) and having a label included
 - functionality changes: 
  * if called after uscr_end, uscr_insert_entries (and similar) will either
    add/overwrite, according to whether the blas_rsb_duplicates_ovw or 
    blas_rsb_duplicates_sum property has been set just after uscr_end;
    default is blas_rsb_duplicates_ovw.
  * if configured without memory wrapper, requests for 
    RSB_IO_WANT_MEM_ALLOC_TOT and RSB_IO_WANT_MEM_ALLOC_CNT will
    also give an error
  * now rsb_file_mtx_load will load Matrix Market files having nnz=0
 - bug fixes: 
  * non-square sparse-sparse matrices multiply (rsb_spmsp) and sum
    (rsb_sppsp) had wrong conformance check and potential off-limits
    writes
  * usmm() used to have beta=0 as default; changed this to be 1 according to
    the Sparse BLAS standard
  * rsb_mtx_clone(): alphap now uses source matrix typecode
  * rsb_util_sort_row_major_bucket_based_parallel() bugfix
  * RSB_IO_WANT_VERBOSE_TUNING used to depend on RSB_WANT_ALLOCATOR_LIMITS.
 - rsbench (librsb benchmarking program (internals)) changes:
  * --incx and --incy now accept lists of integers; e.g. "1" or "1,2,4"
  * rsb_mtx_get_rows_sparse() was not handling RSB_TRANSPOSITION_C and
    RSB_TRANSPOSITION_T correctly until 1.1-rc2. Fixed now.
  * added --only-upper-triangle
  * if unspecified, default --alpha and beta now are set to 1.0
  * when using --incx and --incy with list arguments, with
    --one-nonunit-incx-incy-nrhs-per-type rsbench will skip benchmarking
    combinations with both incX and incY > 1
  * --also-transpose will skip transposed multiply of symmetric matrices
  * --no-want-ancillary-execs is now default
  * in an auto-tuning scan --impatient will print partial performance results
    and update the performance results frequently.
  * small fix in ancillary (--want-ancillary-execs) time measurements
  * --types is a new alias for --type, and 'all' for ':' (all configured types)
  * will tolerate non-existing or unreadable matrix files by just skipping them
  * --reuse-io-arrays is now default (see --no-reuse-io-arrays to disable this)
    and will avoid repeated file loading for the same matrix.
  * --want-mkl-autotune 0/1 will disable/enable MKL autotuning in addition to
    the RSB autotuning experiment.
  * added:
     --skip-loading-if-matching-regex
     --skip-loading-symmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-unsymmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-hermitian-matrices
     --skip-loading-not-unsymmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-more-nnz-matrices 
     --skip-loading-if-less-nnz-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-more-filesize-kb-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-matching-regex and --skip-loading-if-matching-substr
  * if -n <threads> unspecified, will use omp_get_max_threads()
    to determine the threads count.
  * will terminate gracefully after SIGINT (CTRL-c from the keyboard)
  * producing performance record files with
      --write-performance-record <file>
    ( '' will ask for an automatically generated file name)
  * reading back performance record files with --read-performance-record
  * writing no performance record file with --write-no-performance-record
  * --max-runtime will make the program terminate gracefully after a specified 
    maximal amount of time
  * rsbench: LaTeX output of performance records; see options
    --write-performance-record and --read-performance-record
  * --out-res to--out-lhs and --dump-n-res-elements to --dump-n-lhs-elements
  * --want-no-autotune

    (depending on --enable-allocator-wrapper).
  * configure switch to select maximal threads count (--with-max-threads).
  * <rsb-types.h> renamed to <rsb_types.h>.
  * each librsb source file is prefixed by 'rsb' (less probability of object
    file name clash in large applications).
  * RSB_IO_* macros are now declared as enum rsb_opt_t.
  * Doxygen will be only invoked to build documentation if configure switch 
    --enable-doc-build has been enabled.

   * --want-perf-counters option to rsbench (tested with PAPI 5.3; will enable
     additional rsb-originating performance counter statistics to be dumped).
   * zero-dimensioned matrices are allowed.
   * changed row pointers parameter of rsb_mtx_alloc_from_csr_inplace to
     rsb_nnz_idx_t*. 
   * PostScript (RSB_MARF_EPS, RSB_MARF_EPS_S, RSB_MARF_EPS_B) dump with
     rsb_mtx_rndr are more compact now
   * to enable or disable openmp, use either --enable-openmp or --disable-openmp
