* Test output: Expressions
*   Purpose: test simple observable and node evaluation

* Setting a unary observable:

PDG => [int] = unary observable
Hel => [int] = unary observable
Ncol => [int] = unary observable
Nacl => [int] = unary observable
M => [real] = unary observable
M2 => [real] = unary observable
E => [real] = unary observable
Px => [real] = unary observable
Py => [real] = unary observable
Pz => [real] = unary observable
P => [real] = unary observable
Pl => [real] = unary observable
Pt => [real] = unary observable
Theta => [real] = unary observable
Phi => [real] = unary observable
Rap => [real] = unary observable
Eta => [real] = unary observable
Theta_star => [real] = unary observable
Dist => [real] = unary observable
_User_obs_real => [real] = unary user observable
_User_obs_int => [int] = unary user observable
* Evaluating the observable node:

o PDG = [unknown integer]
      prt1 = prt(?)
* Cleanup


* Test output end: expressions_1
