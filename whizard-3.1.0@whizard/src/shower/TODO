!!!!!! TODO
- PYINIT only once? lhapdf_init only once?
- interface for hadronization
	-> writing back: Kf not known for hadrons by W-model
- proper treatment of beam-remnants
	=> if s gets kicked out of hadron, PYTHIA generates meson (sbar + u or d)
- observables (thrust) etc.
	-> so far no global observables present?

!!!!!! partly done
- set PDFset => ticket "Shower takes only current PDF set" ?

!!!!!!! TODO but probably useless
- add support for showering of squarks and gluinos 
- find memory leak <-> many particles(?)

!!!!!!! done
- implement switch to treat all partons emitted in spacelike shower as onshell -> fastisr
- pt_orderd => prt%typ=0 found
- different alpha/Lambda for isr and fsr
- implement switches PYTHIA/WHIZARD, settings  etc.
- color connections in virtuality ordered ISR
